Dance Clone 🕺💫

A real-time AI-powered dance clone that mirrors your body movements using neon glowing skeletons and a dynamic 3D pose viewer.

Dance Clone is a real-time interactive visual experience that creates a mirrored, glowing stick-figure "clone" of the user as they move in front of a webcam. 
Using MediaPipe's Pose estimation, OpenCV for visual augmentation, and Matplotlib for 3D visualization, this project blends motion tracking with cyberpunk-style aesthetics. 
The clone not only mirrors the user’s movements with glowing neon lines and points but also dynamically shifts colors for a more vibrant and futuristic look. 
Additionally, it visualizes the pose in a live-updated 3D skeleton using matplotlib
